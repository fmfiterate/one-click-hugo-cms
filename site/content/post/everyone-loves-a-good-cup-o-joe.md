It all started in 1914, when Secretary of the Navy Josephus “**Joe**” Daniels banned alcohol from all U.S. Navy ships. As this was close to the start of World War I, many young men would soon **find** themselves aboard a ship where the strongest drink available was **coffee**, or a “cup of **joe**.”
